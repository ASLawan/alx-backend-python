# 0x00. Python - Variaeble Annotations
## Introduction to Variable Annotations
This project introduces to __Type Hinting__ in python. Type Hinting in python in writing better python code.  
This ensures that python code is properly documented.   
Variable annotations explicitely defines variable types that is expected to be used in code.  
This helps reduce possibilities of errors and bugs in our code.  
This makes sure our code can be well understood by third parties.
